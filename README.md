# OscGoesBrrr

Make things in real life go BRRR from VRChat. This isn't a VRChat mod, it uses vrchat's OSC!

## Features / Benefits

Why use OscGoesBrrr instead of other OSC solutions?

* One-click setup
  * For avatars with TPS or DPS penetrators and orifices, the avatar upgrader is only one click!
  * For avatars without penetrators or orifices, you easily add them with the in-editor utility.
* Better orifice depth detection
  * Other simple OSC vibe systems don't work properly with different penetrator sizes. Small penetrators can cause an orifice to not vibrate fully, and large penetrators will max out the orifice too early.
  * OscGoesBrrr solves this problem by calculating the length of the penetrator with creative collider tricks. This means your orifice will vibrate fully only when the penetrator is all the way in -- no matter how small or large it is!
* Frottage support
  * Ever just want to rub two penetrators together? With OscGoesBrrr, now you can...
* Body Touch support
  * Even if your partner's avatar hasn't been updated, they can still interact with you by using their hands, feet, or head!
* Easy debugging
  * The OscGoesBrrr app checks your vrchat config, making it easy to identify when OSC or interaction is disabled in game.
